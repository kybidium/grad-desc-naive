# ml-naive

GRADDESC:
A very naive implementation of gradient descent for function approximation of sine based on a Khan Academy article regarding it--aims to replicate the described process without prior knowledge of how these implementations are normally done. Example of functional programming work. Inspired by a project in my Calculus III class, and thus transferred here from my college account (@luisojedacs). Choice of constants is arbitrary right now and implementation is not generalized to other functions.
