# ml-naive

GRADDESC:
A very naive implementation of gradient descent for function approximation of sine based on a Khan Academy article. Aims to replicate the described process without prior knowledge of how these implementations are commonly done. Example of functional programming work. 

Visualizes difference between original function and approximatoin using matplotlib and numpy.

Inspired by a project in my Calculus III class, and thus transferred here from my college account (@luisojedacs). Choice of constants is arbitrary right now and implementation is not generalized to other functions.

Not very optimized at all; arrives at an approximation eventually, but *currently under maintenance* to identify a more systematic way of identifying the tolerance and increment values, or perhaps even refactoring the code to be more logical.

To run:
```
python3 graddesc.py
```
